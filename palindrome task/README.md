Palindrome Checker - Python Program

## Description
This Python program checks if a given integer is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The program converts the number into a string and compares it with its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome.

## Program Functions:
1. **is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool** â€” This method takes an integer `x`, converts it to a string, and checks if the string is equal to its reverse.
-  It returns `True` if the number is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
